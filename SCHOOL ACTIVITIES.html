      <h2>What is the most important thing I learned from the event?</h2>
      <p>I learned that we must not only value our own traditions but also those of other countries because this is where we will truly find the connection within human diversity. By appreciating different cultures, we open our minds to new perspectives and build bridges that unite us beyond borders. Through this, we can find solutions to the problems we face in society.</p>

      <h2>How can I apply what I learned in real-life situations?</h2>
      <p>I can apply this by showing respect and care for other cultures and traditions because we are all brothers and sisters, and we must truly connect with others so that one day we can achieve peace.</p>

      <h2>Did I actively participate in the event? How?</h2>
      <p>Yes, I actively supported our section’s representatives and helped with the preparation for MANA Mo.</p>

      <h2>If I were to teach this topic/subject to a classmate, how would I explain it?</h2>
      <p>I would show them pictures of the problems we face in our society, then help them understand how these issues affect our community, and ask them to come up with possible solutions.</p>

      <h2>Why is it important to have an event for each subject?</h2>
      <p>It helps people respect other traditions and recognize the problems we face in society. By coming together, we can work to solve these issues.</p>

      <h2>What is the most important thing I learned from the event?</h2>
      <p>I learned that science is not just about memorizing formulas, dates, or the names of scientists, but about understanding the world around us and finding solutions to the problems we face in society.</p>

      <h2>How can I apply what I learned in real-life situations?</h2>
      <p>I can apply this by focusing not just on memorizing formulas, dates, or the names of scientists, but by understanding the concepts and trying to apply them to real-world scenarios.</p>

      <h2>Did I actively participate in the event? How?</h2>
      <p>Yes, I actively supported our section’s representatives and volunteered as a technical assistant for the presentation during the research defense.</p>

      <h2>If I were to teach this topic/subject to a classmate, how would I explain it?</h2>
      <p>Instead of simply giving them something to memorize, I would present a real-world problem that we face in society and ask them to create a research proposal project based on it.</p>

      <h2>Why is it important to have an event for each subject?</h2>
      <p>It is important because instead of simply memorizing information from textbooks, we should focus on truly understanding it. This deeper understanding allows us to face real-world challenges and find effective solutions. For example, in the subject of Research, we are taught to investigate issues and develop ways to address problems in society. Through this approach, we can contribute to building a safer and more peaceful world.</p>
